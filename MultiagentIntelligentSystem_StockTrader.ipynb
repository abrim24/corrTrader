    "Every Sector of the Stock Market has stocks whose prices correlate[1] which\n",
    "each other. As the stock market moves up and down, stocks in the same sector\n",
    "often move up and down with each other. But what if there exists correlation[2]\n",
    "between stocks from different sectors?\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "This paper analyzes the approach of detecting inter-sector Stock price correlation,\n",
    "by using a multi-agent intelligent System. There are other papers\n",
    "looking dealing with similar looks at the stock market[3], but this approach will\n",
    "focus the agents on analyzing correlation. Each agent will be a process, which\n",
    "analyzes the correlation between stock prices in a given business sector. For\n",
    "example, one process would analyze the correlation between stock prices in the\n",
    "financial sector. Another process would analyze the correlation between stock\n",
    "prices in the tech sector. These agents will communicate with each other, to\n",
    "find correlation in large datasets.  As you can see from the below November correlation,  There is strong correlation between Energy and Consumer Staples Stocks, and also IT and Industrials Stocks.\n",

    "1.\tRun a correlation coefficient between multiple stock prices, for example 10 prices in a given sector, to determine if the stock prices move up or down together.<br>\n",
    "2.\tIf you find a correlation between prices in a certain sector, continue monitoring those stock prices, and also send the stock information to other processes which are monitoring other sectors.  Thus enabling the other agents to see if stocks which are currently correlating to other stocks in one sector, are correlated to any stocks trending in another sector.<br>\n",
    "3.\tIf you receive a notification from another agent with stocks with are correlated and trending in another sector, calculate the correlation coefficients between those stocks and the stocks in the sector which you are monitoring.<br> \n",
