    "This paper analyzes the approach of detecting inter-sector Stock price correlation,\n",
    "by using a multi-agent intelligent System. There are other papers\n",
    "looking dealing with similar looks at the stock market[3], but this approach will\n",
    "focus the agents on analyzing correlation. Each agent will be a process, which\n",
    "analyzes the correlation between stock prices in a given business sector. For\n",
    "example, one process would analyze the correlation between stock prices in the\n",
    "financial sector. Another process would analyze the correlation between stock\n",
    "prices in the tech sector. These agents will communicate with each other, to\n",
    "find correlation in large datasets.\n",

    "across multiple sectors. This cooperative information from the agents would\n",
    "allow prediction of how stock price trend could move across different sectors.\n",
    "The goal with the agents in this system is finding the correlation coefficient\n",
    "between stocks. Assigning each agent a given sector, or subset of that sector,\n",
    "would allow them to focus on a small piece of the larger puzzle and do so in a fast\n",
